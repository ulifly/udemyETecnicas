// create a function that takes in a list of integers and returns them 
// rearranged into a staircase, if possible, or False otherwise. 

// A staircase is a list of lists where list 0 has length 1, 
// and every list i+1 is one item longer than list i. 
// The order of the elements in the staircase doesnâ€™t matter.
